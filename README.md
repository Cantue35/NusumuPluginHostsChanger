# NusumuPluginHostsChanger
Adds
127.0.0.1 growtopia1.com
127.0.0.1 growtopia2.com to hosts when executed. So the victim can't login. Also you can improve it by changing them to 
127.0.0.1 growtopia7.com, this will make the victim unable to connect also this cannot be fixed by deleting hosts file, the only fix is reinstalling growtopia.
